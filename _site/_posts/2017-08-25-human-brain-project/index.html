<p>The <a href="https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/en/">Human Brain 🧠 Project</a> is a European Research Organization focused on understanding the Human Brain using today’s new computational power. I am part of this international research group thanks to my involvement in the 2017 Young Researcher Event and 2017 Researcher Event respectively in Geneva and Lausanne.</p>

<p>It is the European project to gather data, models and tools 🧰 around a unique platform and alleviate the power a supercomputer across Europe. It is designed to give researchers interested in the field, information on how to use some parts of the platform and how to create collaboration to run 🏃‍♀️ and share their data and results.</p>

<p>The events I attended to were designed to showcase some researchers work on the platform and to let us learn the tools together with the researchers that designed them.</p>

<p>During the course of 4 days, I have focused my interest mainly on the NeuroMorphic Platform and the NeuroBotic Platform. The first one, ☝️ is a platform which regroups two supercomputers with radically new and different designs. The first one called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpiNNaker">SpiNNaker</a> is based in Manchester and the second one called <a href="https://brainscales.kip.uni-heidelberg.de/">BrainscaleS</a> is based in Heideberg. In different they are creating new chip design to allow for ultra fast, large scale brain simulation. I gained now the ability to connect and run simulation on those computers.</p>

<p>The NRP is a simulation interface using <a href="http://gazebosim.org/">gazebo</a> that allows to simulate any physical environment and integrate any physical objects : houses, 🏠 , tables, balls, 🎾 , rats, 🐀 , robots, etc..
It allows for many ways to connect your simulated animals/robots to the HBP supercomputers -making it controllable by spiking neural networks- or any other scripts and Machine Learning interfaces. Removing the need to test complex Neural Networks on <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/">MNIST</a> data or having to create robots, 🤖 to test it. It transforms a tedious process of creating the robots, developing the right controls and uploading/connecting the algorithm.</p>
