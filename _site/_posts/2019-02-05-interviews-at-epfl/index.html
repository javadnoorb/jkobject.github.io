<p>During the last week of January I had the chance to enter the hiring program of <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/">EPFL’s</a> edcb <a href="https://phd.epfl.ch/edcb">program</a>.</p>

<p>There I spent four days with many PIs and around twice as much students 👩‍🎓👨‍🎓 all over the world interested in computational biology🧪 . Each of them were extremely bright.</p>

<p>Lausanne is this unique place at the center of Europe where you feel a similar atmosphere of entrepreneurship and enthusiasm and research as one would in the US.</p>

<p>Here I had the chance to meet with many great researchers such as Pr. Naef working on answering fundamental questions on cellular rhythms. 
Pr. La <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lwsjpbMAAAAJ&amp;hl=fr">Manno</a> who tries to understand the dynamics of cellular differentiation through methods of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0414-6">RNA velocity</a>. 
Pr. Rahi which tries to model the dynamical interaction of interaction networks in cells. 
Pr. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=H7Y-wqQAAAAJ&amp;hl=fr">Barth</a> which is using knowledge in protein conformation to membrane receptors applying it to cancer research and immunotherapies. 
Pr. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bXoXq2AAAAAJ&amp;hl=fr">Manley</a>, which is using methods of <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super-r%C3%A9solution">super-resolution</a> microscopy to see more about cells and proteins.</p>

<p>As usual most of them were initially trained physicists. Each of them had specific projects using machine learning which I have been able to relate to a lot.</p>

<p>I also had the chance to present my past research projects (that you can find on <a href="http://www.jkobject.com">this website</a>) and which slides are available online: <a href="https://fr.slideshare.net/jkalfon/epfl-edcb-phd-candidate-presentation">here</a>.
It seems that the researchers had a good interest in me and my background which made me very proud and enthusiastic. 
Moreover I love skiing🎿 and Lausanne is 45mns away from “les pistes”. (Which is a nice 👍 added bonus right?).</p>
