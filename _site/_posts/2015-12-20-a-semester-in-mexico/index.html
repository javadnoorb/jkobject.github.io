<p class="text-center">During my third year of undergraduate studies, I went on to do a semester exchange in Mexico.🇲🇽</p>

<p>The city, 🌃 of <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/v1AqC4zcLtF2">Queretaro</a> of the eponym region is placed in the center of Mexico and tops a 2000m plateau.</p>

<p>There I studied computer, 💻 science, design and statistics at the Tec de Monterey. We lived at 5 students (unfortunately all French friends in a big house, 🏠 in the UNESCO heritage city center.</p>

<p>I would be lying, to say the least, to say we worked hard during this time. My 6 month stay was filled with trips across Mexico, night out in the city, tasting amazing foods and drinks, 🍸 .</p>

<p>We visited <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/4og8n1qw7oz">Teotihuacan</a>, Mexico DF, <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/nwVbFpmk5o32">Puerto Escondito</a>, <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/a82ZTsA2a9S2">Puerto Vallarta</a>, <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/LKFnHVtVuu92">Morelia</a>, <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/vQhWoMSQoXL2">Xochimilco</a>, <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/WcNqvCZuT5P2">Tolantongo</a>, S<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/dGKj1H7XnqK2">an Miguel de Allende</a>, G<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/WcbdikdDZXN2">uadalajara</a>, <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/tjaebNC9jFM2">Xilitla</a>, S<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/mieBkTBGePt">an Luis de Potosi</a>, <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/9XEWGxYsr132">Tequila</a> and many more.</p>

<p>There I had a tons of fun but also tons of problems. I was alone and could only count on myself. It taught me a lot. Things that cannot really be taught otherwise as I could not even translate it into words.</p>

<p>I think, 💭 it is going back from Mexico that I really became an adult. This experience was formative.</p>

<p><strong>I really miss it now !</strong></p>
