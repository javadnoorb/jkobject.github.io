# Nature, The Spirit & God. 

Nature, The Spirit & God these are words the we hear often. We live with them and we embrace their significance for us and for others. A lot of us had made judgements, life decisions and some event lost life on the autel of their significance.

But these are also some of the words for which there is no definitions. Everyone use them and no one really aggrees on what they mean.

It has been quite a time since I have forbidden them in my debates and my decisions. But why is that? How come they be bad when they convey so much good?

First what do they mean?
For some nature, natural, natalité in french, in the broadest sense, is the natural, physical, or material world or universe. "Nature" can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general. The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of science. Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena.

The word nature is derived from the Latin word natura, or "essential qualities, innate disposition", and in ancient times, literally meant "birth"

Natura is a Latin translation of the Greek word physis (φύσις), which originally related to the intrinsic characteristics that plants, animals, and other features of the world develop of their own accord. From which we get the concept of physics and the study of nature became physics, biology etc.. from this study we were able to modify nature to our will. Modifying our environment and ourselves. From the counscious knowledge of things that were hear before and things that were here because of us, we decided to create another disctinction. modified nature caused by a natural thing getting knowledge of the nature of nature had would then be deemed artificial. I would like to emphasize on the term "counscious". Because we might look at an apple thinking of how natural it is but it had been made by man. In one way or another most of the nature we encounter today would not enter the definition of nature. 

So why do we do this distinction? and why is nature so important to us?





Nature, The Spirit & God:
These are also words that one could say never meant anything for him. But Everyone has such words. It can be freedom, equality. They belong to the same family of projection words. Word for which only us have a definition. concepts on which we projects our fear, our passions our selves.
