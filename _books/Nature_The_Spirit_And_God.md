# Nature, The Spirit & God. 

Nature, The Spirit & God these are words the we hear often. We live with them and we embrace their significance for us and for others. A lot of us have made judgments, life decisions and some, even lost life on the altar of their significance.

But these are also some of the words for which there is no definitions. Everyone use them and no one really agrees on what they mean.

As a self proclaimed scientist, I will try to explain in this series, some of these words, why are they dangerous and what science has to say about them. All in a goal to create clearer definitions and maybe help the scientific discourse reach the public more easily.

It has been quite a while since I have tried to ban them in my friendly debates and my decision-making. But why is that? How come they be bad when they are here to convey so much good?

It stems from a belief that I gained that for all the topics that divide us, the incomprehension between old/young, educated/not, french/american, rightist/leftist. Most of it has to do with a set of words for which we have completely different definitions and meaning. A belief that, to heal some of our divide, we would need to come up with consistent truth about each, unregarding of our beliefs. 

There is words that one could never exactly pinpoint a definition for. But words that everyone uses. It can be freedom, equality, love. They belong to the same family of projection words. In our minds, every word/concept is the projection of a set of events, other projections that are linked in a peculiar way. Thus we all have a specific definition for each words. However some of them have stricter definitions, ones that allow humans to correct each other and refine them as time goes on: 1, 2, multiply, H2O, aluminum, sphere. Some other are less defined: car, tissue, street, cloud. Other are pure projection words. These are the one we are talking about here. they are ones for which everyone associate its own definition, desires, events. Concepts on which we projects our fear, our passions, our-selves. Cut concepts that we use with one another, believing they are the same.

But First, what do/should they mean?


## Nature

For some nature, natural, natalité in french, in the broadest sense, is the natural, physical, or material world or universe. "Nature" can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general. The study of nature is a large part of science, if not science itself. Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena.

The word nature is derived from the Latin word natura, or "essential qualities, innate disposition", and in ancient times, literally meant "birth"

Natural is a Latin translation of the Greek word physis (φύσις), which originally related to the intrinsic characteristics that plants, animals, and other features of the world develop of their own accord. From which we get the concept of physics and the study of nature became physics, biology, etc.

From this study and with time and engineering, we were able to modify nature to our will. Modifying our environment and ourselves. 
With the faster increase of this modification and the increase of human lifespan, we started realizing the trans-formative power that humans can have. Not that it only started then, but only then were we able to see, across only one generation, changes in our environment (likely caused by man). From this new found knowledge of things that change and things that don't, or don't seem to,  we decided to create another distinction: Artificial.

But why do we do this distinction? and why is nature so important to us?
Why then would this modified nature, itself caused by a natural object, us, be deemed artificial?

As people could witness what changed and what stayed both physically and culturally. Nature thus become of reference of the things which were before us, before humans. Or so we think. Because of this historical reason why nature emerged. It mostly became a 

Because we might look at an apple thinking of how natural it is but it had been made by man. In one way or another most of the nature we encounter today would not enter the definition of nature.


Nature: pollution, extinction, universe


Spirit: counscioussness, love, freedom.


God: history, death, the meaning of life.
